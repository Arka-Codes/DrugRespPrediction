# Portfolio Summary / Resume Bullet Points

## Project: AI-Driven Drug Response Prediction (Bioinformatics/ML)

*Designed and implemented a reproducible machine learning pipeline to predict cancer drug sensitivity (IC50) using high-dimensional gene expression data (GDSC).*

- **Bioinformatics Pipeline:** Engineered a robust preprocessing workflow including isoform matching, low-variance gene filtering, and Z-score normalization for transcriptomic data.
- **Machine Learning:** Developed and tuned XGBoost and Random Forest regressors, outperforming linear baselines by capturing non-linear gene-drug interactions (Validation RMSE optimized via 5-Fold CV).
- **Interpretability:** Implemented feature importance analysis to extract top biomarker candidates, linking "Black Box" model decisions back to biological pathways.
